#  edMotion Pod Task 01: GitHub Account & Data Analyst Portfolio

**Welcome to your first EdMotion pod task!** By the end of this task, each pod member will have a professional GitHub presence, a published data analysis project, and a live portfolio site — built from scratch, together.

---

## 🧩 How This Works

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| **Pod** | Your small team of 3–4 people. You learn together, review each other's work, and hold each other accountable. |
| **Fork** | Your personal copy of this repo. You'll work on your own fork and track your progress there. |
| **Shared Pod Repo** | One repo your pod creates together to collaborate, share resources, and showcase the pod's collective work. |

## 📋 Milestones

This task is broken into 4 milestones. Complete them in order.

| # | Milestone | What You'll Build | Est. Time |
|---|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | [GitHub Setup](milestones/01-github-setup.md) | GitHub account, Git installed, first fork | 30–45 min |
| 2 | [Profile README](milestones/02-profile-readme.md) | A GitHub profile that positions you as a data analyst | 45–60 min |

## 🤝 Pod Collaboration

### Individual Work
- Each person **forks this repo** to their own GitHub account
- Complete all milestones on your own fork
- Check off tasks as you go using the checkboxes in each milestone file

### Pod Work
- One pod member creates a **shared pod repo** (instructions in Milestone 1)
- Each member is added as a collaborator
- Use the shared repo to practice pull requests, issues, and code review
- Track the pod's progress using the [Pod Checklist](pod-checklist.md)

### Pod Reviews
After each milestone, review at least one pod member's work:
1. Visit their fork, profile, or project repo
2. Open an **Issue** with constructive feedback
3. Use the title format: `EdMotion Pod Review: Milestone X - [Your Name]`

For data projects specifically, review:
- Is the analysis question clear?
- Are the findings easy to follow?
- Could someone reproduce the analysis from the README alone?
