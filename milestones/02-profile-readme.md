# Milestone 2: Profile README

**Goal:** Create a GitHub profile README that positions you as a data analyst and tells your story.

**Estimated time:** 45–60 minutes

---

## What Is a Profile README?

GitHub lets you create a special repo with the same name as your username. If that repo has a `README.md` file, it shows up on your profile page like a personal landing page.

For data analysts, this is your first impression. It should answer: *What kind of analyst are you? What tools do you use? What problems do you like solving?*

---

## Step 1: Create Your Profile Repo

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name the repository **exactly** your GitHub username
   - If your username is `jane-analytics`, the repo name must be `jane-analytics`
3. Make sure it's set to **Public**
4. Check **Add a README file**
5. Click **Create repository**

You'll see a notice that says *"This is a special repository"* — that means you did it right.

---

## Step 2: Edit Your README

1. Open the `README.md` file in the repo
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) to edit
3. Replace the default content with your own

### What to Include (Data Analyst Edition)

Use the template in [templates/profile-readme-template.md](../templates/profile-readme-template.md) as a starting point, then make it yours.

A strong analyst profile README covers:

- **Who you are** — your name, your background, and what drew you to data
- **Your analytical focus** — what kinds of problems excite you (business intelligence, marketing analytics, operations, financial data, public data, etc.)
- **Your toolkit** — be specific and honest:
  - **Languages:** Python, SQL, R
  - **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Data tools:** Excel/Google Sheets, pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks
  - **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, SQLite
  - **Other:** Git, Google Colab, Kaggle
- **What you're working on** — current focus, your EdMotion pod task, goals
- **How to reach you** — email, LinkedIn, portfolio link

### What Makes an Analyst Profile Stand Out

- **Specificity over buzzwords** — "I analyze customer churn patterns using cohort analysis in SQL and Python" beats "I'm passionate about data-driven insights"
- **Show, don't tell** — Link to actual projects, notebooks, or dashboards
- **Be honest about your level** — "Currently learning" is more credible than claiming expertise you don't have

## Step 3: Learn Basic Markdown

Your README is written in Markdown — a simple formatting language. Here's what you need:

| What You Want | What You Type | What It Looks Like |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Heading | `# Big` / `## Medium` / `### Small` | Headings of different sizes |
| Bold | `**bold text**` | **bold text** |
| Italic | `*italic text*` | *italic text* |
| Link | `[text](url)` | [text](url) |
| Image | `![alt text](image-url)` | Displays an image |
| List | `- item` | • item |
| Code | `` `code` `` | `code` |

You can preview your changes by clicking the **Preview** tab in the GitHub editor.

## Step 4: Commit Your README

1. Scroll to the bottom of the editor
2. Write a commit message like: `Add analyst profile README`
3. Click **Commit changes**
4. Visit your profile page at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME` — your README should be live!

---

## Step 5: Pod Review

1. Share your profile link in your pod's shared repo (open an Issue or add it to the README)
2. Visit each pod member's profile
3. Leave feedback as an Issue on their profile repo:
   - Title: `EdMotion Pod Review: Profile README - [Your Name]`
   - Does the profile clearly signal "data analyst"?
   - Are the tools and skills specific enough?
   - One thing you liked, one suggestion for improvement

---

## 💡 Tips

- Search "data analyst GitHub profile README" for inspiration
- Keep it concise — hiring managers skim in 10 seconds
- Update it as your skills grow — this is a living document
- If you have a Kaggle profile, Tableau Public gallery, or blog — link to those too
